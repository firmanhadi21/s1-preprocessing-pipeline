# Notes:
# - orbit_direction: null means both ascending and descending will be used
# - This maximizes temporal coverage and fills gaps
# - Histogram matching normalizes radiometric differences between orbits
# - For Java Island with 12-13 scenes, using both orbits is recommended
# - Expected: ~400-450 scenes total for full year
