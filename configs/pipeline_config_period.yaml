# Period-Based Pipeline Configuration
# Processes all 31 12-day periods for a full year
# Output: 31-band GeoTIFF ready for rice growth stage mapping

directories:

data_acquisition:
  download_source: asf  # Use ASF for automatic download

  # Area of Interest - Define your region
  # Example: Central Java rice-growing area
  aoi_bbox: [110.0, -7.5, 111.0, -6.5]  # [west, south, east, north]

  # Year will be specified via command line (--year 2024)
  # Each of the 31 periods will be downloaded automatically

mosaicking:
  # Enable histogram matching between overlapping scenes within each period
  histogram_matching: true
  # Reference scene selection: 'first', 'largest', or 'center'
  reference_scene: center
  # Output resolution in meters
  resolution: 10.0
  # Resampling method
  resampling: bilinear

training:
  # Model configuration for rice growth stage mapping
  model_type: cnn_lstm
  use_augmentation: true
  use_class_weights: true
  use_smote: true

prediction:
  # Default periods for prediction (can override via command line)
  periods: [7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
  use_optimized: true

# Notes:
# - Period 1 = Jan 1-12, Period 31 = Dec 27-31
# - For training: all 31 periods are needed
# - For prediction: minimum period is 7 (needs 7 bands for backward window)
# - Adjust aoi_bbox to your region of interest
